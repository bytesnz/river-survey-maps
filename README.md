River Survey Maps
==========
https://codepen.io/bytesnz/full/dpKRoW/

[Thames21](http://www.thames21.org.uk) has a collection of
[water quality](http://www.thames21.org.uk/thames-river-watch-water-quality/)
and [litter surveys](http://www.thames21.org.uk/thames-river-watch-litter/)
collected over the years. They currently have basic maps showing all the survey
with no ability to filter these based on a particular time range. I am
developing this code (originally in Codepen.io) to allow filtering and better
visualisation of the survey data.
